Hello, developers!
Sorry, i used Vite instead of Webpack, so before running the project - write in console in folder with project:

npm install vite --save-dev
npm install axios

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Few moments:

I was able to complete most of the tasks:

- Transferred design and logic from the Figma mockup.
- Connected the Users and Positions databases, fetched data via GET requests, and displayed the list of users using map.
- Set up token generation and prepared data for the POST request.

However, I faced some difficulties:

- I couldn’t successfully complete the POST request (I suspect issues with sending photos, as I haven’t practiced sending images before, or with connecting the token – although the token was generated correctly).
- I lacked sufficient knowledge to bundle the project with Webpack (I spent a day searching for information, following video tutorials, reading documentation, and even using GPT for guidance).
